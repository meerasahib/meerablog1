It has been  12 years since assigned the duty in royal palace.There is couple of km long sea front.In fact ,my duty is in shore.I used to attend the site if and only if  there is any critical problem .Divers are frequently visiting the site for checking the security installation deep in  water.During the rest hour they are not actually rest instead go for fishing with special tools in hand.We are around five crew taking care of technical issues.Most of them don't have much knowledge about swimming or diving.There is small fibre boat available for accessing on shore site.Some crew knows very well about steering boat.Many time  I want to take some fish home but not successful.Sometime asking from divers but they didn't provide.Other crew from our team go for fishing in different way such as by hook  and fishnet.Sometime they are lucky to catch big fish in 2- 5kg range .unfortunately I didn't available on site during the time of fishing.But without failure  next day they notified about catching big fish.Similarly I hear the voice from them for 12 years .So one day I decided to go with them for fishing.They asked to me to come earlier for fishing.We all togather gone for fishing with hope of catching big fish .Already for  one hour we were on shore to catch fish.Suddenly captain called to return to shore immediately for safety and security reason.All the hope for return with fish gone in fraction of second.Twelve years of dream still not come true.Only I am experiencing till now is nothing but  total failure.
    .......THE END....
